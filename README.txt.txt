This small twitter sentiment analizer was created as final projecto for the Python3 Course
provided by the University of Michigan through Coursera. 

The code extracts the information from a CSV file provided by the course management that 
has fake twitter information. It then analizez de amount of positive or negative words
in eacdh twit text and returns a csv files that lists the number of retweets versus
a netscore of positive and negative words. 

I copied the original CSV file from the clss platform so I could work in Atom by having
python read it and then copypasting it. Since we were not provided the lists of positive and
negative words i took the ones provided at https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html
